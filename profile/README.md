## Hi there 👋

The digital landscapes has become too complex. Concurrently, central digital abstractions (data lake, date mesh, digital twin, etc) being driven by marketing have become too vague leading to both confusion in designing systems as well as breaking interoperability.

In addition, the software-first, centralized "platform" approach has resulted in a fragmented internet centralized around a couple of tightly controlled, surveillance driven walled-gardens (plantations? [^1]).

These two issues form the backdrop in which **Protecta Studio** was born. 

We approach the problem of building complex digital lanscapes as a three-step process, in specific 

software precise artifactualizations and architectures. Our work falls on the intersection of R&D and design (too R&D for the design people; too design for the R&D people). 


Our current internal pet project is the *Offering Framework*, a set of recommendations for establishing inter-organizational data exchange and governance, with an anti-platform format. We usually build our internal 

We also do provide consulting service (data architecture strategy / integration / governance / inter-organizational)
